### About
This is the ***Coffee Machine*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p> In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification.</p>
<p>You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
</ul>
